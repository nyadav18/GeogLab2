# Public Opinion Regarding the Houseless Populations of Three Major Cities
## Analysis of wordclouds produced through the use of a Twitter API crawler and geo-tagged tweets
###### Seattle / New York City / San Francisco

In an effort to understand the general public opinion of Twitter users living in cities with major houseless populations, I used the search terms **houseless** and **homeless** to account for variations in vocabulary and changes in acceptable ways to refer to this marginalized population. As the wealth gap in the United States widens,
seemingly without any signs of slowing down, the economic disparity is most clearly visualized in the growing populations of houseless people in almost every major city in the country. Governmental policy can be shaped by the voters who reside in these effected cities, but those with extreme financial means and stake in the game tend to have a little bit more swaying power. Still, public opinion has influence especially when residents can reach a consensus on the issue at hand. For this reason, I carried out this project to examine the similarities and differences between wordclouds built with tweets from NYC, Seattle, and San Francisco.
